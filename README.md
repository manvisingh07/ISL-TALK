## Objectives and Scope 

The objective of the project is to convert English text language to Indian Sign Language using Natural Language Processing to enhance the communication capabilities of people with hearing disabilities. Our project aims to encompass the domain of Indian Sign Language which roughly consists of 1500 words in its dictionary. 
For each of these words its corresponding video will be gathered. For words which do not fall in this dictionary, they would be there. Thus, it is targeted to all those who wish to learn this translation, to facilitate better communication placed by their synonyms considering duplication of words as well as their parts of speech.
